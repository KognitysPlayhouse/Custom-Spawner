This plugin likely is going to have conflicts and not be outright compatible with several other plugins. Let me know which ones aren't compatible and which ones are in your testing and I'll add them in the list below.

# Server Config Setup
You need to go to your config_gameplay.txt file and change the team_respawn_queue to:
`team_respawn_queue: 55555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555`
This is done to ensure no one spawns at the start of the round and so it doesn't screw anything up with any other plugins.

# Plugin setup:
1. Change the spawn queue plugin config located at your Exiled configs directory to your liking.
2. Change the plugin config values to your liking (Upper text, bottom text, discord invite and whether or not you want a broadcast shown to players to show what team they're voting for)
3. Profit
